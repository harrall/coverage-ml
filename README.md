To use machine learning techniques to explain broadband coverage
This report describes the Rural broadband coverage project that is the second of two projects required for the last course 
in the "Professional Certificate in Data Science" programme at Harvard University.  
Broadband internet access became commercially available in many countries in the late 1990s, and has become a very popular service 
among households and businesses. In Norway, more than 95% of households have some sort of Internet access at home. There is a large
gap, however, between the haves and the have-nots: The average download speed for Norwegian residential users is currently more than 
150 Mbit/s, but the variation is high and many households have only access to a 20 Mbit/s service or even less. 
Most of the homes and businesses with access to low broadband speeds are located in rural areas, and rural Internet coverage is 
the scope of this report. The main data set that I have used for the project includes Internet coverage information about almost
458 000 buildings in rural Norway. The data set is publicly available and is published annually by Nkom, the Norwegian telecoms 
regulator. It has data for all buildings - also urban - but I filtered out the urban buildings since Internet coverage in general 
is rather good and it is normally profitable to build high-speed networks in urban areas.  
This is not always the case in rural areas: The cost of deploying a broadband network is highly correlated with distance between 
customers, and almost per definition this distance is higher in rural areas. Statistics Norway defines an urban areas as an area 
with at least 200 inhabitants (ca 100 homes) and less than 50 metres between houses. Among rural buildings in the dataset, 
ca 45% have access to a 100 Mbit/s, while the average for all buildings in Norway is close to 90%.
